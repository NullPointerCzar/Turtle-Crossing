# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple turtle crossing game built using Python and the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to help a turtle cross a busy road without getting hit by cars. The player controls the turtle's movement using the keyboard.

## Features

- Control a turtle that moves upward to cross the road.
- Randomly spawning cars move horizontally across the screen.
- Levels increase as the turtle successfully crosses the road, with cars moving faster at higher levels.
- The game ends if the turtle collides with a car.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` script to start the game.
2. Use the Up Arrow Key to move the turtle forward.
3. Avoid colliding with the moving cars.
4. Reach the top of the screen to level up. 
5. The game ends if the turtle gets hit by a car.
